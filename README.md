# databasemon
This is a basic web application written in JavaScript using the React library, Express for routing, and MongoDB noSQL database. The overall idea is to have one definitive website for collectors of digimon figures to reference. The website utilizes CRUD functionality so users who have created accounts and are logged in can add to the database and fix errors on existing entries. Soon this project should be updated with a category filter and search method. Adding an option for a user to track there personal collection is also something that will be added in the near future.
